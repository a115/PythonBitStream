Bits of Python - Keep improving your Python skills, one bit at a time

## What is it? 

Bits of Python is a learning resource for people interested in continuously and actively improving their Python skills. Whether you are learning Python or have been using it professionally for years, our promise is that you will find something new and interesting in every "bit" to help make your Python code better. 

Each "bit" contains explorations around a concise, self-contained topic or mini-project. Bits come with clean, well documented solutions, emphasising the "Pythonic way" of approaching common and non-trivial problems.

Mini-projects are inspired by real-world industry problems, academia, or coding competitions. They range from relatively simple to fairly sophisticated, although we try to keep the codebase minimal for easy digestion, so edge cases may often be left as exercises for the reader. 

Intermediate and advanced Python concepts are introduced in the context of the projects and explained clearly, with links to further resources where appropriate. Learners are encouraged to explore further with suggestions for exercises, additional reading and community discussions. 

## What is the format? 

The Python code from each bit is published to the public GitHub repository `a115/PythonBitStream`. You are encoraged to post your questions and commentary as GitHub issues (tagged with the relevant bit as a milestone) and to explore the issues and comments submitted by others.
