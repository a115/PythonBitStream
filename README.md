Bits of Python - Keep improving your Python skills

N.B. Currently only available in the UK! 

## What is it? 

Bits of Python is a (paid) subscription-based learning resource for people interested in continuously and actively improving their Python skills. Whether you are learning Python or have been using it professionally for years, our promise is that you will find something new and interesting in every "bit" to help make your Python code better. 

Each "bit" contains explorations around a concise, self-contained topic or mini-project. Bits are delivered by e-mail to paid subscribers and come with clean, well documented solutions, emphasising the "Pythonic way" of approaching common and non-trivial problems.

Mini-projects are inspired by real-world industry problems, academia, or coding competitions. They range from relatively simple to fairly sophisticated, although we try to keep the codebase minimal for easy digestion, so edge cases may often be left as exercises for the reader. 

Intermediate and advanced Python concepts are introduced in the context of the projects and explained clearly, with links to further resources where appropriate. Subscribers are encouraged to explore further with suggestions for exercises, additional reading and community discussions. 

## What is the format? 

We aim to deliver a new bit every other week, as a set of PDF documents delivered by e-mail to our subscribers. On weeks when a bit isn't published, the weekly e-mail to our subscribers contains updates, follow-up discussions, insightful comments from readers, further pointers to resources and relevant news from the Python world. 

The Python code from each bit is published to the public GitHub repository `a115/PythonBitStream`. Subscribers are encouraged to post their questions and commentary as GitHub issues (tagged with the relevant bit as a milestone) and to explore the issues and comments submitted by staff and other community members. 

There are also challenges and mini-contests throughout the year, with prizes for the best solutions (provided by our UK corporate sponsors.)

## How much does it cost? 

_Basic subscription_ is £3.98 per week and includes every new bit delivered to you in PDF format by e-mail hot off the press, with weekly updates in-between.

The _Active Professional_ add-on is £14.98 per week. It includes priority support and access to the Top-Devs UK Slack instance, where you can discuss the bits with fellow members, pursue career progression or freelance work and get community support on any other Python-related topic.

## Can I subscribe outside of the UK?

If you do not reside in the UK, you are still welcome to subscribe to the Basic Subscription. You will be able to read the bits and e-mail updates and participate fully in the community activity on GitHub. You will, however, be ineligible to receive prizes for contest submissions. You will also not be eligible for the "Active Professional" upgrade and access to Slack. 

We do plan to launch in other countries in the future, so if we launch in your country, we will be happy to migrate your subscription and enable missing features.
