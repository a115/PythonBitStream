# Bit1: Command-line tool to generate invoices from timesheets

In our first Bit of Python we will write a simple Python utility to generate invoices for workers who have been logging their time in a timesheet. 

In the process, we will see how to structure our code as a collection of small, composable functions. We will also learn how to work with command-line arguments, JSON files, Python generators, using _f_-strings to format text and data and a few other tricks.
